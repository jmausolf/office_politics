		message = inspect.cleandoc("""Dear {0}:

			I am writing in response to your notice for the {1} position at your {2} office. I am a doctoral candidate in {6} at {5}, specializing in the application of recurrent neural networks in cloud computing. {3} is a leader in data science and artificial intelligence, and I am confident, together, we would be a great match.

			As a computer scientist, I have both the theoretical knowledge and applied experience to make a difference at {3}. As you can see from my resume, I have not only developed enhanced RNN algorithms in Java, but also used Python, Scala, and SQL to apply deep neural nets and streamline ETL pipelines as a data science intern for both {4}. Collectively, my background in computer science, statistics, and mathematical modeling gives me first-hand experience into the crux of today’s complex computational puzzles in data science and their applications at the frontier of artificial intelligence.

			Although I have strong methodological strengths and my doctoral degree underscores my ability to tackle complex problems, I also strive to work as a team player, whether it's by collaborating with colleagues at {4} to communicate data-driven solutions or spearheading fundraising initiatives and leading a diverse set of students during my tenure as {7}. I think you will agree that my computational background—combined with my outgoing charisma and penchant for collaborative leadership—makes me a valuable recruit for the data scientist position at {3}.

			I want you to know that I am excited to submit my application to {3}. Attached, please find a copy of my resume. I look forward to speaking with you soon so that we can discuss the position further.

			Warm regards,

		message = inspect.cleandoc("""Dear {0}:

			I hope this email finds you well. I recently came across the {1} position at {3}'s {2} office. As a doctoral candidate in {6} at {5}, I research the application of nonparametric bound estimation for deep reinforcement learning, a type of computer vision. Given, {3}'s opportunities in data science and artificial intelligence, I would love to contribute my talents.

			With my background in computer science, I exhibit both the academic theory and pragmatic qualifications to be impactful at {3}. As evidenced in my resume, I have not only developed C++ libraries to optimize deep learning, but I have also used Python, SQL, and Hadoop to improve ETL server efficiency and provide impactful analytics as a data science intern for both {4}. In combination, my training in artificial intelligence, mathematics, and statistics, provides insight at the vanguard of data science.

			Beyond my methodological prowess and acute facility to unpack and solve intricate data questions, I also embrace collaborative work, such as my efforts at {4} to share actionable data solutions or my past initiatives as {7} to direct fundraisers and organize student activities. Collectively, my abilities to excel in team environments, lead group inititiatives, and develop computational solutions demonstrate the value I could bring to {3}.

			{0}, I am excited about this opportunity at {3} and eager to discuss next steps. To that end, I have attached a copy of my resume for review. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

			All the best,
