Dear Jonathan:

I am writing in response to your notice for the Research Scientist position
at your New York office. I am a doctoral candidate in Machine Learning at
Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in the application of recurrent
neural networks in cloud computing. Facebook is a leader in data science
and artificial intelligence, and I am confident, together, we would be a
great match.

As a computer scientist, I have both the theoretical knowledge and applied
experience to make a difference at Facebook. As you can see from my resume,
I have not only developed enhanced RNN algorithms in Java, but also used
Python, Scala, and SQL to apply deep neural nets and streamline ETL pipelin=
es
as a data science intern for both Microsoft and Twitter. Collectively, my
background in computer science, statistics, and mathematical modeling gives
me first hand experience into the crux of today=E2=80=99s complex computati=
onal
puzzles in data science and their applications at the frontiers of
artificial intelligence.

Although I have strong methodological strengths and my doctoral degree
underscores my ability to tackle complex problems, I also strive to work as
a team player, whether its by collaborating with colleagues at Microsoft
and Twitter to communicate data-driven solutions or spearheading
fundraising initiatives and leading a diverse set of students during my
tenure as president of the Harvard College Democrats. I think you will
agree that my computational background=E2=80=94combined with my outgoing ch=
arisma
and penchant for collaborative leadership=E2=80=94makes me a valuable recru=
it for
the data scientist position at Facebook.

I want you to know that I am excited to submit my application to Facebook.
Attached, please find a copy of my resume. I look forward to speaking with
you soon so that we can discuss the position further.

Warm regards,

 Ryan
